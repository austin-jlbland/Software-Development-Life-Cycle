I think that creating user stories is a very helpful approach to keeping requirements documented and easily accessible. I try to stay open-minded and attentive when listening to the user. Ultimately, they are who I am trying to please, and if I don't understand what they want, then I will be unable to do so.

When approaching development I try to rely on what I have learned and source what ever know how is needed to stay effective. I work very hard to stay humble and learn whatever is needed to develop good effective programs. Moving forward in development and testing, I think that the overarching agile structure is what I really want to incorporate into my future work. Where everyone has a role to play and the communication flows on principle. 

Being a good team member means that you effectively complete the work that you are responsible for and you are willing to help resolve issues any time that you think you can. You communicate often, transparently, and effectivly to keep the team up to date and aligned with the goals assigned.
